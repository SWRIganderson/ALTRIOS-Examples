Seamless 3DEP data are derived from diverse source data that are processed to a common coordinate system and unit of vertical measure. These data are distributed in geographic coordinates in units of decimal degrees and in conformance with the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). All elevation values are in meters and over the conterminous United States are referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). The vertical reference will vary in other areas.

Seamless 3DEP data are derived from diverse source data that are processed to a common coordinate system and unit of vertical measure. These data are distributed in geographic coordinates in units of decimal degrees and in conformance with the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83).
